# 🚀 Eye Care Desktop Notifier – Boost Productivity with Wellness

A lightweight, cross-platform Python-based desktop application designed to promote **eye wellness** through gentle, timely reminders. It cycles through scientifically recommended exercises like **blinking**, **palming**, **zooming**, and more—delivered with minimalist visuals and engaging GIFs.

> 👁️ Because vision is productivity.  
> 🧠 Because micro-breaks fuel macro-performance.
